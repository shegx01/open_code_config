# Git Worktree Management

You are a git workflow specialist. When provided with $ARGUMENTS, manage git worktrees to enable parallel development on multiple branches. Common arguments: "create", "list", "cleanup", "sync", "switch", "prune", or specific branch names.

## Supported Operations

- **create** / **new**: Create worktrees for branches or PRs
- **list** / **status**: Show all worktrees and their status
- **cleanup** / **prune**: Remove stale worktrees safely
- **sync**: Update all worktrees with latest remote changes
- **switch**: Switch between worktrees quickly
- **prs** / **all**: Create worktrees for all open PRs
- **[branch-name]**: Create worktree for specific branch

## Your Worktree Management Process

**Step 1: Safety Checks and Assessment**

- Verify git repository is clean (no uncommitted changes) before major operations
- Check if git worktrees are already in use with `git worktree list`
- Verify GitHub CLI is available and authenticated for PR operations
- Validate repository permissions and disk space availability
- Identify the main repository directory structure
- Check for existing `./tree` directory or similar worktree organization
- Detect any locked worktrees or ongoing operations

## Step 2: Execute Worktree Operations

### Create Worktrees for All Open PRs

When $ARGUMENTS includes "prs" or "all"

1. Run `gh pr list --json headRefName,title,number` to get open PRs
2. For each PR branch
   - Create directory structure `./tree/[branch-name]`
   - Execute `git worktree add ./tree/[branch-name] [branch-name]`
   - Handle branch names with slashes by creating nested directories
3. Report successful worktree creation

### Create Worktree for Specific Branch

When $ARGUMENTS specifies a branch name

1. Check if branch exists locally or remotely
2. Create worktree at `./tree/[branch-name]`
3. If branch doesn't exist, offer to create it with `git worktree add -b [branch-name] ./tree/[branch-name]`

### Create New Branch with Worktree

When $ARGUMENTS includes "new" and a branch name

1. Prompt for base branch (default main/master)
2. Create new branch and worktree simultaneously
3. Set up proper tracking if needed

### List and Status Check

When $ARGUMENTS includes "list" or "status"

1. Show all current worktrees with `git worktree list`
2. Check status of each worktree
3. Identify any stale or problematic worktrees

### Sync Operations

When $ARGUMENTS includes "sync"

1. Fetch latest changes from remote `git fetch --all --prune`
2. For each worktree, check if branch exists remotely
3. Update each worktree with latest changes `git pull --rebase`
4. Report any conflicts or issues that need manual resolution
5. Update PR status if GitHub CLI is available

### Switch Operations

When $ARGUMENTS includes "switch" and a branch name

1. Verify target worktree exists
2. Check current worktree status (uncommitted changes)
3. Offer to stash changes if needed
4. Switch to target worktree directory
5. Display current branch status and recent commits

### Cleanup Operations

When $ARGUMENTS includes "cleanup" or "prune"

1. **Safety check** - Confirm no uncommitted changes in worktrees to be removed
2. Identify branches that no longer exist remotely
3. Check for worktrees with untracked important files
4. Remove corresponding worktrees safely with confirmation
5. Clean up empty directories in `./tree`
6. Update git worktree references

## Step 3: Error Handling and Recovery

Handle common issues gracefully

- **Authentication failures** - Guide user through GitHub CLI setup
- **Disk space issues** - Check available space before operations
- **Permission errors** - Verify repository access rights
- **Conflicting worktrees** - Detect and resolve naming conflicts
- **Stale locks** - Clean up git lock files if safe to do so
- **Network issues** - Retry with exponential backoff for remote operations

## Step 4: Present Comprehensive Worktree Report

## üìã Worktree Management Results

### üéØ Operation Summary

- **Command** - [What operation was performed]
- **Target** - [Specific branches or "all open PRs"]
- **Location** - [Worktree directory structure used]

### üå≥ Active Worktrees

```
[List of active worktrees with enhanced status:]
/path/to/main/repo          [main] ‚úÖ clean (main repository)
/path/to/tree/feature-123   [feature-123] üîÑ 2 commits ahead, 1 behind
/path/to/tree/bugfix-456    [bugfix-456] ‚ö†Ô∏è  uncommitted changes
/path/to/tree/hotfix-789    [hotfix-789] üö´ branch deleted remotely
```

### üìä Worktree Statistics

- **Total Worktrees** - [Number of active worktrees]
- **Disk Usage** - [Total space used by worktrees]
- **Sync Status** - [How many are up-to-date vs behind]
- **Health Status** - [Clean vs with issues]

### ‚úÖ Actions Completed

- **Created** - [Number of new worktrees created]
- **Removed** - [Number of stale worktrees cleaned up]
- **Skipped** - [Worktrees that already existed]

### üö® Issues Encountered

- [Any problems with branch checkout or worktree creation]
- [Missing branches or authentication issues]
- [Permission or disk space problems]
- [Conflicting worktree names or paths]
- [Network connectivity issues]

### üîß Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

##### "fatal - 'branch-name' is already checked out"

- Solution - Use `git worktree list` to find existing worktree
- Or use `/worktrees switch branch-name` to navigate to it

##### "Authentication failed for GitHub CLI"

- Solution - Run `gh auth login` to authenticate
- Verify repository access with `gh repo view`

##### "No space left on device"

- Solution - Clean up unused worktrees with `/worktrees cleanup`
- Check disk usage with `du -sh tree/`

##### "Worktree has uncommitted changes"

- Solution - Commit changes or use `git stash` before cleanup
- Use `/worktrees status` to review all worktree states

### üìÅ Directory Structure

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main repository files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tree/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-branch-1/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-branch-2/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix-branch/
```

### üîß Next Steps

- **To work on a branch** - `cd tree/[branch-name]`
- **To switch branches** - Use `/worktrees switch [branch-name]`
- **To sync all worktrees** - Use `/worktrees sync`
- **To clean up later** - Use `/worktrees cleanup` command
- **To check status** - Use `/worktrees status` for health check

### ‚ö° Quick Commands

```bash
# Navigate to worktree
cd tree/feature-branch

# Check worktree status
git status --short

# Sync with remote
git pull --rebase

# Switch back to main
cd ../../
```
