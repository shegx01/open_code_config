### TypeScript

- Prioritize type safety and avoid `any` usage
- Follow TypeScript/JavaScript naming conventions
- Use interfaces and type definitions for contracts
- Implement functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Use `npm`/`yarn` for package management
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Leverage modern async/await patterns
- Maintain clean module boundaries and imports
