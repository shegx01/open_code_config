### Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

- Use expect/actual declarations for platform abstraction
- Follow Kotlin naming conventions (camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Implement coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Structure code with proper common/platform separation
- Use `./gradlew` for builds and testing
- Write tests for all target platforms
- Leverage sealed classes and data classes appropriately
- Handle nullability with Kotlin's type system
