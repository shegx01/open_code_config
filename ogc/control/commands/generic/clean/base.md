# Code Quality Cleanup

You are a code quality specialist. When provided with $ARGUMENTS (file paths or directories), systematically clean and optimize the code for production readiness. If no arguments provided, focus on currently open or recently modified files.

This command is language-agnostic and auto-detects the primary stack. Default priorities: Elixir and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP).

## Your Cleanup Process

**Step 1: Analyze Target Scope**

- If $ARGUMENTS provided: Focus on specified files/directories
- If no arguments: Check git status for modified files and currently open files
- Identify language(s) by sentinel files and extensions, then select appropriate tools

**Step 2: Clean and Optimize**

- For each language, run appropriate cleanup tools (e.g., formatter, linter, optimizer)
- Remove language specific unused variables, logger, and insect files
- Additional cleanup steps may include:
